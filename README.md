# SilverBot
A general bot for Discord written in Node.js! (originally made by @razefeixx, modified and released by @chanonlim)  
Documentation: https://chanonlim.gitbook.io/silverbotv1  
If you want to use the unreleased version, see the "dev" branch. Note that it is NOT tested and may NOT work.  
Note: The "master" branch currently has the same code as "dev" so it is also not yet stable.
