# SilverBot
A general bot for Discord written in Node.js! (originally made by @razefeixx, modified and released by @chanonlim)  
Prerequesites:  
You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 8 or higher along with NPM Package Manager and ImageMagick CLI to host this bot.  
FFmpeg will be downloaded automatically.  

Setup guide:
1. Download the bot files from here and extract it. (Not finished yet)
2. Go to the folder where you extracted it and type `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the launcher. If an update is availible, I recommend that you install it.
4. Select "Configure SilverBot" and follow through.
5. Run `npm start` again and select "Launch SilverBot" or "Launch SilverBot w/ auto-restarts"
6. Enjoy!  

Maintainance:  
To update the bot via the command line, run `npm run update`. The updater will automatically download the bot if there are updates and will install new dependencies if any is required.  
To reconfigure the bot, start the launcher via `npm start` then choose "Reconfigure SilverBot". Follow the guide again.
